# Nussinov algorithm
The described task is an educational task, which is from  'Bioinformatics Algorithms, Fall 2023' Stepic course. 
Implement the Nussinov algorithm that obtains the secondary structure of the RNA sequence with the maximum number of paired bases.
Minimal size of hairpin - 3.
Print a list of paired bases separated by spaces as an output.
Input: <seq>
Output: <pos1> <pos2> <pos3> <pos4>
The output of such 4 numbers will denote two pairs (<pos1>, <pos2>) (<pos3>, <pos4>).
Position indexing starts at 1, not zero.

Sample Input 1:
